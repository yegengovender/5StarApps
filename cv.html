    <heading>Skills & Experience</heading>
    <sub-section>ASP.NET C# - 6 years (2008-present)</sub-section>
    <info>
        <p>5 years working with MVC. Worked with webforms prior to that. I began using Telerik controls in the webforms days, and moved on to
        MVC when it was in version 2. Worked with and understand Razor, but prefer using standard HTML and CSS. Since getting familiar with
        MVC API, I am now more comfortable using the MVC framework more for JSON POSTs and requests, while handling the View with Javascript
        and HTML.</p>

        <p>On the server side, my focus is on solution structure and I have used Ninject for IOC, but most times use poor-man's
            dependency injection so as not to be too coupled to framework and configuration. Resharper is usually my right hand when I
            am coding and refactoring. In terms of database integration, I have made the progression from ADO to Linq-to-SQL to
            Entity Framework. Also use Dapper on occasion.
        </p>

    <sub-section>Javascript - 7 years (2007 - present)</sub-section>
    <info>
        <p>I started using Javascript when trying to rebuild an intranet site at Regent insurance. I wasn't happy with the classic ASP
        implementation, and was building a prototype and at the same time teaching myself PHP, HTML, CSS and javascript.</p>

        <p>This was a pivotal period in my career, as it was my first experiments with actual Web Application development. I
        discovered the magic of AJAX and nothing was the same since. Over the last 2 years I have become quite well versed in
        AngularJS. I used think that Jquery was the bomb, until I stumbled upon MVVM frameworks and learned KnockoutJS. Shortly
        afterwards I came across AngularJS, and now try to use it with everything I can.</p>
    </info>
    <sub-section>HTML and CSS - 7 years (2007-present)</sub-section>
    <info>
        <p>Since starting web development, I am always inclined to stick to basic HTML instead of server-side tags. I have
        a working understanding of LESS and SASS. Still coming to grips with the new semantics of HTML5.</p>
        <p>CSS 3 has been tons of fun to experiment with, especially the transitions and keyframes which eliminate the need
        for hacking the view with scripting.</p>

    <sub-section>Other Technologies</sub-section>
    <info>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SQL Server (versions 2000-2012)</strong> - One does not develop for so many years in .Net without SQL. Probably the
            most comprehensive persistence layer I've worked with.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharepoint (versions 2010, 2013)</strong> - Just recently, I worked on the company Sharepoint upgrade. Learned some
                of the new Client-Side Object Model, as well as the REST API, to create some custom Web Parts.</li>
        </ul>
    </info>
    <sub-section>Still learning...</sub-section>
    <info>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TDD</strong> - I have been trying to get this right for years. Although it is challenging, the philosophy
            is compelling, and the quality of code that is produced by merely keeping it in mind makes it invaluable.</li>
            <li><strong>Node JS</strong> - The introduction of a server-side Javascript framework needs no advertising. I hope to
            make this a primary focus area in my development skills.</li>
        </ul>
