            <h3>The most important aspects of software</h3>

            <p>
                Good software has to satisfy the end user and the developer. For the user, the product needs to be
                <strong>operational</strong>, <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>predictable</strong>. <br/>
                For the developer, the code should be <strong>readable</strong>, <strong>maintainable</strong> and
                <strong>testable</strong>.
            </p>

            <h4>Operational</h4>

            <p>
                To put it simply, it has to work. A piece of software that doesn't do anything or doesn't do what it
                should is useless. The most important aspect of any software and the first goal is for it to be
                operational.
            </p>

            <h4>Stable</h4>

            <p>
                Once we have an application that is working, the next most important concern is that it does not break.
                The software should execute it's task and not cause any internal or external errors.
            </p>

            <h4>Predictable</h4>

            <p>
                One should have a fairly good idea of what the system will do when subjected to common circumstances and
                conditions. If the requirements of the system are properly defined, the expected behaviour can be
                measured via manual
                or automated testing. The execution of the system through it's behaviour under varying environmental
                conditions will increase its predictability.
            </p>

            <h4>Readable</h4>

            <p>
                Code should be readable. Consistent naming conventions and organised class structure ensure that reading
                through the code will reveal what functionality is coded.
            </p>

            <h4>Maintainable</h4>

            <p>
                Software is never written once. There are continuous episodes of adding functionality and enhancements.
                The code should be written such that adding new features or modifying existing features is an intuitive
                and painless process.
            </p>

            <h4>Testable</h4>

            <p>
                The ability to add unit tests to the code will ensure confidence that the behaviour expectations of the
                software are met, and serves as a safety net that will catch changes that break existing functionality.
                The ability of tests to run small pieces of code without having to run the entire system help to make sure that
                features are working as they are being developed.
